# My MNIST Adventure

This is my exploration in to neural networks using the MNIST dataset. Please view the MNIST.ipynb file to view a summary of all of my work. 

For this project I run a dockerised jupyter notebook which I start using the start_jupyter.bat file. If you wish to clone this repository please change start_jupyter.bat to suit your own configuration file before running it.

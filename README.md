# My MNIST Adventure

This is my exploration in to data analysis, with a particular focus on neural networks, using the MNIST dataset. Please view the MNIST.ipynb file to view a summary of all of my work. 

For this project I run a dockerised jupyter notebook. Simply start the container with `docker-compose up` in the root directory.
